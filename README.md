# Tab Filter

Tab Filter is a Sublime Text plugin for quickly switching between open tabs.  Invoking Tab Filter brings up a "GoTo Anything"-like quick input showing your opened tabs for the current window, allowing you to quick filter on file names to rapidly switch amongst existing tabs.

## Compatibility

This plugin is compatible with Sublime Text 2 and 3.

##### Windows

I don't currently run Windows, so not sure where the packages live on that platform.  The plugin will work on Windows, though, so if anyone wants to contribute the directories that apply to Windows XP, Vista, 7, or 8, please feel free.
